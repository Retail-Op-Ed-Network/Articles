Retail Advocacy Market Equality

By Bob Mahalo

This journey has given me the opportunity to engage with highly intelligent people who are not finance professionals. 

Also looking through many of the regulations that are supposed to guard rail the market participants from perpetrating systemic risk, seems instead to have allowed loopholes for the risk to be passed on outside of the people creating the risk without fear of loss. 

The efforts now are not on creating more carvouts for profit at tax payers expense, rather on a complete overhaul creating a more simplistic system. 

IMO the only reason for the system to be this complex is to allow for violations with certain exceptions. Unfortunately it appears the courts are tilted against regular people. 

This battle is going to be more complicated than ever and will need to be addressed on an individual basis by individuals. 

Kaizen - Change for the better. A market that benefits a couple thousand people at the expense of millions of peoples retirement accounts needs to change.
