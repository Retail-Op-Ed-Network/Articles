Short Interest-The Infinite Money Glitch

By Bob Mahalo

After reviewing many pages and sources of rules it is becoming apparent that the Short Interest was, by Design, never actually meant to be calculated. 

If we take a quick peek into some of the mechanisms that obfuscate the full view maybe a clear picture will begin to emerge. A recent Bloomberg article shows Goldman Sachs marking short sales as long on 60 million occasions. 

Cloaked behind the term conspiracy, many market incumbents brush aside allegations as Meme theories. 

this might be difficult to quantify how many shares are sold short if the dealer marks them long. 

Another masked method is swaps with open reporting until the last few years. This data has been taken down from public view and will not be released again until new codes and 'all data integrity issues are addressed.

A third method to avoid public accountability is called Ex-Clearing, or Broker to Broker, by means of manual transaction processing outside the watchful eyes of the regulators. 

Lets not forget goodwill among industry insiders. FTDs generate FTRs. The receiving party of this transaction does not force delivery of the securities attempting to generate future goodwill. 

The Obligation Warehouse houses FTDs that were not fulfilled until a time when they can be matched and settled. This is where Fails go to die.

With no expiration date, and no forced closures, Fails can stay here indefinitely. 

Certainly there are many more methods Wall Street insiders have carved out through lobbyists and 'Proprietary' methods that can't be shared with regulators. The question remains, Can the market be saved, or must it be rebuilt completely?
