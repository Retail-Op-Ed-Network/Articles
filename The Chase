The Chase

By Oldinnew

I actually almost exited around the time DFV did with like $30 profit, at least half of the 8 I ended up with. But decided to go for it, knowing my value would be tough to recover without a mega spike, if week of 14th wasn’t a riser. 

Hence, bigger lesson was the $125s. They were deadly. 

I actually rolled my Oct 18 125s (4 total) into 2 Oct 18 70s and 1 Oct 60. Still scared too gambly, because I could have grabbed like a Jan 16 2026 $50 instead. Only 1 compared to the 3, but so much more time.

May be building in the Jan 2026s next, instead of defending my October position. Lost about $900 on my 125 June 21 volatility ‘chase’. It’s funny. GME options are the big leagues. $900 very different than $90.

Hopefully, well worth the lesson. I aim to make it so. Still confident in my sandboxing to stay on the field. But I may be leaving some on the table with my October position playing it safe. It’s going to be hard not to take a few hundred dollar profit when I see it, even if it’s tomorrow.

Which is ultimately why I shied away from the Jan 2026, and went with the October. Why pay all the extra premium when I can only get one and know I’ll sell early? If I had 2, it’d be different a bit.

I’m confident in my own instinct that we’ll see some activity upon which I can take profit between now and October. May change in a few weeks, or a few weeks from then. Eyes wide open, again.
