# Retail Op-Ed Network

*An Independent Collective of Retail Investors and Research Hobbyists*

Welcome to the GitHub home of the Retail Op-Ed Network, a grassroots collective of individual retail investors and curious minds who enjoy exploring markets, companies, laws, and legislation related to investing and asset ownership. We are not professionals — just a group of passionate hobbyists who like to dig in, discuss, and share our independent research for educational and collaborative purposes.

## What This Repository Is

This repository serves as a collaborative workspace to:

- Collect and organize member-written articles and research drafts.
-	Collaborate on editing and refining content before publication.
-	Serve as an archive of our collective thoughts and evolving ideas.

Final versions of selected articles may later be published in other mediums, such as blogs, newsletters, or public platforms.

As a collective, we pledge to:

- Share our opinions and research with honesty and clarity.

- Strive to provide extensive documentation of sources when able.

We believe that thorough sourcing not only strengthens our work but also supports a culture of learning — both within our group and in the broader public.
