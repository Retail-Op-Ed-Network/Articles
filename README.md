Retail Op-Ed Network

An Independent Collective of Retail Investors and Research Hobbyists

Welcome to the GitHub home of the Retail Op-Ed Network, a grassroots collective of individual retail investors and curious minds who enjoy exploring markets, companies, laws, and legislation related to investing and asset ownership. We are not professionals—just a group of passionate hobbyists who like to dig in, discuss, and share our independent research for educational and collaborative purposes.

What This Repository Is

This repository serves as a collaborative workspace to:
•	Collect and organize member-written articles and research drafts.
•	Collaborate on editing and refining content before publication.
•	Serve as an archive of our collective thoughts and evolving ideas.
Final versions of selected articles may later be published in other mediums, such as blogs, newsletters, or public platforms.

What This Is Not

•	This is not a source of financial advice.
•	This is not a source of legal advice.
•	This is not an authoritative research outlet.
•	This is not affiliated with any financial institution or professional advisory body of any type.
No member of the Retail Op-Ed Network is a licensed financial or legal professional. All content should be considered amateur opinion and personal exploration—not guidance for investment and legal recommendations.

Our Approach

We believe in:
•	Open collaboration and respectful discussion.
•	Transparency in our ideas, limitations, and methods.
