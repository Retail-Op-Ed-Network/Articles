Stockbroker Liquidation

By Bob Mahalo

SIPA will not allow a broker to reorganize in bankruptcy. Liquidation prioritizes 'clients' over unsecured creditors. 

These liquidations are overseen and requested by SIPC. Moving accounts to more stable brokerage is top on the list. 

DRSed shares held in the broker, are returned to the customer(possibly transferred back to TA), while 'street name' securities are liquidated and customer claims are paid in cash. 

In the event of fraud, or misuse of 'street name' securities by the broker prior to broker liquidation, SIPC is the insurance that pays the customer cash(up to $500K) to settle the claim once the brokers asset pool is used. 

If the aggregate pool of customer property is insufficient to return each customer to his or her prebankruptcy position, the customersâ€™ deficiency claims will share pro rata from the pool of non-customer property with general unsecured creditors.
