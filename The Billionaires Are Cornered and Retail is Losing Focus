The Billionaires Are Cornered and Retail is Losing Focus

By Bob Mahalo

After efforts to unpack the regulations and processes that reportedly control the financial markets one becomes numb to the persistent violations perpetrated daily. 

Groups of retail investors standing by ready to devour New DD, perspective, rules, and even Finance Media posts, are all to eager to squash and even ban regular contributors because they already heard about a subject the OP wants to bore down on. 

IMO as research is on the cutting edge, efforts must also be maintained on reviewing and refining prior discoveries.

The vocal 120 commenters who tend to only want brand new information posts to be allowed are the voices that seem to call for new investors, who may not have had the opportunity to read 3 years of DD. 

Sending them to read the library works for some, but how many have just thrown in the towel and moved on. A recent trip allowed me to engage with people far outside my normal circle, and the perception is complete ignorance, or vague memories of meme stocks. 

How do Advocates for fair markets hone in with laser like focus and begin to topple the regimes that have maintained regulatory capture and continue to suck retail investors dry?
