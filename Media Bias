Recent events surrounding the “Meme stock” Craze have highlighted the painful tilt in reporting accurate finance news. A single retail investor has got the finance world looking for answers.

PFOF, ETF Share creation, Naked Short Selling, Fails To Deliver, misreporting short sales as long sales…have all been standard operating procedure for Wall Street for decades and no mention of the strain they put on the system, nor the drain they have on Pensions and IRAs.

Yet, now an individual has identified the flaws in the system and done nothing illegal and the finance news would lead you to believe this “Meme Lord” is responsible for the system cracking.

The onus now lies with the reader of this article to investigate for themselves the true criminal behavior in the markets.
